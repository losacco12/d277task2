                    Before becoming an incorporated city, Chicago was home to native americans. The name Chicago is believed to originate from native language. The believed translation of the name "Chicago" is "stinky onion" or "striped skunk" after the 
                    Chicago was incorporated as a town in 1833 and later incorporated as a city in 1837. Prior to being incorporated, Chicago was home to the U.S. government's Fort Dearborn(destroyed and no longer standing). The city started as a trade hub using the Chicago River and Lake Michigan for maritime shipping.
                    A major part of Chicago's history is "The Great Chicago Fire" of 1871. This fire decimated almost every building in the city. After the fire, there were large rebuilding efforts with many modern buildings being constructed, including the first skyscraper in the United States.
                    Chicago is now home to over 100 skyscrapers including the Willis Tower. The Willis tower was originally named the Sears Tower and it served as Sears headquarters until 2015. The Sears Tower was the tallest building in the world from 1974 to 1998.
